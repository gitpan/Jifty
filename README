NAME
    Jifty -- Just Do It

DESCRIPTION
    Yet another web framework.

  What's cool about Jifty? (Buzzwords)
    DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
        Jifty tries not to make you say things more than once.

    Full-stack
        Out of the proverbial box, Jifty comes with one way to do everything
        you should need to do: One database mapper, one templating system,
        one web services layer, one AJAX toolkit, one set of handlers for
        standalone or FastCGI servers. We work hard to make all the bits
        play well together, so you don't have to.

    Continuations
        With Jifty, it's easy to let the user go off and do something else,
        like fill out a wizard, look something up in the help system or go
        twiddle their preferences and come right back to where they were.

    Form-based dispatch
        This is one of the things that Jifty does that we've not seen
        anywhere else. Jifty owns your form rendering and processing. This
        means you never need to write form handling logic. All you say is "I
        want an input for this argument here" and Jifty takes care of the
        rest. (Even autocomplete and validation)

    A Pony
        Jifty is the only web application framework that comes with a pony.

  Introduction
    If this is your first time using Jifty, Jifty::Manual::Tutorial is
    probably a better place to start.

METHODS
  new PARAMHASH
    This class method instantiates a new "Jifty" object. This object deals
    with configuration files, logging and database handles for the system.
    Most of the time, the server will call this for you to set up your
    "Jifty" object. If you are writing command-line programs htat want to
    use your libraries (as opposed to web services) you will need to call
    this yourself.

    See Jifty::Config for details on how to configure your Jifty
    application.

   Arguments
    no_handle
        If this is set to true, Jifty will not create a Jifty::Handle and
        connect to a database. Only use this if you're about to drop the
        database or do something extreme like that; most of Jifty expects
        the handle to exist. Defaults to false.

  config
    An accessor for the Jifty::Config object that stores the configuration
    for the Jifty application.

  logger
    An accessor for our Jifty::Logger object for the application.

  handle
    An accessor for the Jifty::Handle object that stores the database handle
    for the application.

  web
    An accessor for the Jifty::Web object that the web interface uses.
