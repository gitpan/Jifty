This directory contains Debian packaging files for Jifty.

There is a debian repository at:

deb http://jifty.bunting.net.au/ ./

Containing all my packages.  
There are still some packages required from ubuntu edgy that are perl
only modules.  Things should work with dapper with the addition of the
perl modules from edgy.

This is as yet hardly tested so don't be surprised if things break.

Please let me know if they do and I'll try and fix them.
