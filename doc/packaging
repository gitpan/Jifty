For Jifty:

* It should be possible for Jifty's developers to package bin/jifty as a 
  single platform-specifc "runnable" application, including lib/ share/ and all
  non-core perl dependencies. (+ libraries?)



For any Jifty application:

* It should be possible for an end-user to package the source code of a Jifty 
  application as a single platform-specific "runnable" application.

* Ideally, it should be possible to turn a packaged application into 
  an unpacked copy of the application's source code and dependent libraries.

* It should be possible to install a Jifty application on a local disk 
  such that multiple instances of the application can run with only
  a site_config.yml file. (or without it)

* It should be possible for an end user of one of these installed
  applications to snapshot the application and all its assets, internal
  libraries and dependencies to a private directory)

    In all cases:
        * --with-deps includes the installed versions of our dependencies.
        * plugins are treated as CPAN dists for the purposes of dependency management

    jifty package --file /tmp/myapp.exe --with-deps
        * Takes multiple forms of targets
        * Defaults to the zipped form
        * --file is the path of the output file 

    jifty dist --with-deps
        * make a source distribution of this application, suitable for handing to a developer
    jifty isolate  --with-deps 
        * needs a better name 
        * Pull in all dependencies, as well as jifty.

    jifty install/uninstall
        * some sort of management. will also work on plugins
