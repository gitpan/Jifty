When I click "next page", 


    If I don't have ajax, reload the whole page, with the changed helper parameters.


        To reload the whole page, I'm going to need:

            * All args to the current page.
            * Which args should go away
            * Which new args should be added.



        Basically, this is 
        
            BASE PATH: framework->current_url
            
            PARAMS:  framework->current_request_args
                with this_element->new_version_params replacing
                      this_element->current_version_params
                


    if I have ajax, refetch the enclosing div, with the changed parameters.
        To reload just that section of the page, I'm going to need:

            * The path to the bit I want to replace.
            * The name of the surrounding div to replace it with?
            * The moniker? of the section to replace.
            * The parameters I should pass to that section.
             Are those the same as the things for the next-page link?


        Basically, this would be: 
        
            BASE PATH this_element->direct_url (no params?)
                  and replace  this_element->current_version_params
                  with this_element->new_version_params
