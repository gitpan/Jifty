21:36 <obra> so. what would people like to see out of a jifty plugin framework?
21:39 <audreyt> I'd like to see that a dispatcher plugin cannot affect an action plugin
21:43 <obra> What do you mean? I'd expect that a plugin would be able to install dispatcher rules and actions
21:43 <obra> so we could make the "EditFile" thing a plugin
21:44 <audreyt> I'd like to see JiftyX::EditFile::Dispatch
21:44 <audreyt> er Dispatcher
21:44 <audreyt> JiftyX::EditFile::Action
21:44 <audreyt> as separate namespaces (maybe inside the same EditFile.pm)
21:44 <audreyt> of course, JiftyX is better spelled as Jifty::Plugin
21:44 <obra> Jiftyhashi?
21:45 <audreyt> Java has coffee beans
21:45 <audreyt> maybe Jifty has tea bags
21:45 <audreyt> Jif::Tea::Bag
21:45 <obra> *groan*
21:46 <obra> so. about plugins
21:46 <obra> I guess there are two different things here
21:46 <obra> 1) plugins for parts of jifty should be in the right namespaces
21:46 <obra> 2) should a plugin be able to install dispatcher rules directly?
21:46 <obra> ie, "use this plugin and it adds rules at these trigger points"
21:48 <obra> I want "Login" and "Signup" to become plugins
21:48 <obra> so I can stop cargo culting them between apps
21:48 <audreyt> so sorta like rt callbacks
21:48 <obra> yeah. was thinking more like plagger's system. it looks pretty
21:48 <obra> named points. so even if they move between files, you don't lose
21:48 <audreyt> yup
21:49 <obra> so. this means I need to be able to:
21:49 <obra> install actions
21:49 <obra> install dispatcher rules at all stages
21:49 <obra> install static content
21:49 <obra> install templates
21:49 <obra> possibly install widgets (aka form fields)
21:49 <obra> install javascript libs and css files
21:50 <obra> (special cases of static content)
21:50 <obra> (but also hooks to add those things to the generated header)
21:50 <audreyt> right
21:50 <obra> what else am I missing? ;)
21:50 <obra> oh. new jifty commands?
21:51 <audreyt> po files are considered templates?
21:51 <obra> # ./bin/jifty fooplugin
21:51 <obra> no. pofiles are anotehr item for the list
21:51 <audreyt> declare dependency? (normal cpan semantics?)
21:51 <obra> another
21:51 <obra> yeah. I'd just use perl require lines
21:51 <audreyt> partial ordering? (run this before that)
21:52 <obra> in dispatchers?
21:52 <obra> or actions?
21:52 <obra> or what?
21:57 <audreyt> sorry
21:57 <audreyt> from callbacks
21:57 <obra> nod. I worry a little bit about the complexity. when would we want it for callbacks other than the dispatcher rules?
21:58 <audreyt> if all your login etc are in well known places
