bps_util.js
    focusElementById removed
    custom onload hook code removed
    buttonToLink, updateParentField, createCalendarLink, createDateTimeLink moved to Jifty.Utils

removing JSAN usage wherever I can
removing JSAN core and now-unused libraries

formatDate not used in the last 3 years


=== What's left?

grep 'XXX TODO JS'

use DatePicker from jQuery UI instead of YUI
    removes YUI calendar
    most (all?) of our calendar handler JS

Jifty.Utils has a bunch of methods probably redundant with those in jQuery, but
we need to check compat with what uses them

update libraries
    jQuery
    iAutocompleter (and iUtil)

jQuery 1.4
    http://jquery14.com/day-01/jquery-14#backwards
    we can replace css_browser_selector and our own browser stuff with jQuery.browser now


=== Unused (but still useful??)

DUBIOUS - rico.js - not even the full library, just corner rounding, and
                    hacked ones at that

UNCLEAR - jsTrace.js
