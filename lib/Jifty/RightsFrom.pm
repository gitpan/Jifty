=head1 NAME

Jifty::RightsFrom

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Application::Model::Thing;
  use Application::Model::Person;

  use Application::Record schema {
    column owner => refers_to Application::Model::Person;
  }

  use Jifty::RightsFrom column => 'owner';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides a C<delegate_current_user_can> method that various
task-related objects can use as a base to make their own access
control decisions based on their
task. L<Jifty::Record/current_user_can> uses this method to make an
access control decision if it exists.

Note that this means that you a model class can use Jifty::RightsFrom,
and still have a custom C<current_user_can> method, and they will not
interfere with each other.

=head2 export_curried_sub HASHREF

Takes:

=over

=item sub_name

The subroutine in this package that you want to export.

=item export_to

The name of the package you want to export to.

=item as

The name your new curried sub should be exported into in the package
C<export_to>


=item args (arrayref)

The arguments you want to hand to your sub.

=head2 delegate_current_user_can C<'column'>, C<$column_name>, C<$right_name>, C<@attributes>

Make a decision about permissions based on checking permissions on the
column of this record specified in the call to C<import>. C<create>,
C<delete>, and C<update> rights all check for the C<update> right on
the delegated object. On create, we look in the passed attributes for
an argument with the name of that column.
