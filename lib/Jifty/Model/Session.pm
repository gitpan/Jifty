=head1 NAME

Jifty::Model::Session - Jifty session tracking

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Every Jifty application automatically inherits this table, which
tracks session information for the application.  Individual keys in
the session structure are stored as rows, making session updates take
constant time, and also reducing the need for locking.

package Jifty::Model::Session;
use Jifty::DBI::Schema;
use Jifty::Record schema {

column session_id => type is 'varchar(32)', is case_sensitive, is indexed;
column data_key => type is 'text', is case_sensitive;
column value => type is 'blob',
  filters are 'Jifty::DBI::Filter::Storable';
column created => type is 'timestamp',
  filters are 'Jifty::DBI::Filter::DateTime';

  filters are 'Jifty::DBI::Filter::DateTime';

=head2 table

Sessions are stored in the table C<_jifty_sessions>.

=cut

sub table {'_jifty_sessions'}

=head2 since

Sessions first started getting stored in the database in Jifty version
0.60428

=cut

sub since { '0.60428' }

=head2 current_user

Everyone is treated as the superuser when dealing with session
objects.  This avoids infinite recursion, as otherwise it would try to
look up the current user in the session object to find out who we
are...

=cut

sub current_user { return Jifty::CurrentUser->superuser }

=head2 new_session_id

Returns a random new session id.  This is a 32-character hex string.

=cut

sub new_session_id {
    return Digest::MD5::md5_hex(
        Digest::MD5::md5_hex( time() . {} . rand() . $$ ) );
}

=head2 create

Defaults the created and updated times to now.

=cut

sub create {
    my $self = shift;
    my %args = (
        session_id => $self->new_session_id,
        key_type   => "key",
        created    => DateTime->now,
        updated    => DateTime->now,
        @_,
    );

    return $self->SUPER::create(%args);
}

=head2 before_set_value [VALUE]

Updates the C<updated> column, in addition to setting the value.

=cut

sub before_set_value {
    shift->set_updated( DateTime->now );
}
