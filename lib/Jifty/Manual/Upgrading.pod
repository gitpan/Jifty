=head1 NAME

Jifty::Manual::Upgrading

=head2 DESCRIPTION

Jifty provides a way for you to upgrade the database schema and data
of your application between versions.  If all you are doing is adding
new models or columns to existing models Jifty will do the upgrade
almost automatically.  If more extensive changes are required you need
to write some code to tell Jifty what to do.

=head1 HOW TO

=head2 New models and columns

=head3 Adding a new model

When adding a new model to your application you need to tell Jifty
at which version of your application the model was created.  To do
this add a since sub to your new model class.

 sub since { 0.0.5 }

=head3 Adding a new column to an existing model

When you have a existing model and decide that you need to add another
column to it you also need to tell Jifty about this.  This is done by
using since as well, however the since goes into the column
definition itself.  

 column created_by => refers_to Wifty::Model::User, 
		      since '0.0.20';


=head2 data migration and schema changes

If a file called C<Upgrade.pm> exists in your application it will be
run by C<jifty schema --setup>.

Upgrade.pm can be used to make any schema changes or to manipulate
your applications data.

At the very least your C<Upgrade.pm> should contain the following: 

 package MyApp::Upgrade;

 use base qw(Jifty::Upgrade);
 use Jifty::Upgrade qw( since rename );

 since '0.6.1' => sub {
	....
 };

The C<since> function is where you do all the work.  Each C<since>
will be run in version order until the application is up to date.


=head3 Renaming a column

To rename a column use C<rename> inside your C<since>.  You will also
have to use the model class at the top of Upgrade.pm so Jifty can
access it's schema definition.

use MyApp::Model::User;

since '0.61' => sub {
  rename (table => 'MyApp::Model::User', 
	  column => 'zip', 
	  to => 'postcode'
	 );
};
