=head1 NAME

Jifty::Action::Record::Update - Automagic update action

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is used as the base class for L<Jifty::Action>s that are
merely updating L<Jifty::Record> objects.  To use it, subclass it and
override the C<record_class> method to return the name of the
L<Jifty::Record> subclass that this action should update.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 arguments

Overrides the L<Jifty::Action::Record/arguments> method to further
specify that all of the primary keys B<must> have values when
submitted; that is, they are
L<constructors|Jifty::Manual::Glossary/constructors>.

=cut

sub arguments {
    my $self = shift;
    my $arguments = $self->SUPER::arguments(@_);

    # Mark read-only columns for read-only display
    for my $column ( $self->possible_columns ) {
        if ( not $column->writable and $column->readable ) {
            $arguments->{$column->name}{'render_mode'} = 'read';
        }
    }

    # Add the primary keys to constructors and make them mandatory
    for my $pk (@{ $self->record->_primary_keys }) {
        $arguments->{$pk}{'constructor'} = 1;
        $arguments->{$pk}{'mandatory'} = 1;
        # XXX TODO IS THERE A BETTER WAY TO NOT RENDER AN ITEM IN arguments
        $arguments->{$pk}{'render_as'} = 'Unrendered'; 
        # primary key fields should always be hidden fields
    }
    
    if ( $self->can('PARAMS') ) {
        use Jifty::Param::Schema;
        return Jifty::Param::Schema::merge_params(
            $arguments, ($self->PARAMS || {})
        );
    }
    else {
        return $arguments;
    }
}

=head2 validate_arguments

We only need to validate arguments that got B<submitted> -- thus, a
mandatory argument that isn't submitted isn't invalid, as it's not
going to change the record.  This is opposed to the behavior inherited
from L<Jifty::Action>, where mandatory arguments B<must> be present
for the action to run.

However, constructor arguments are still required.

=cut

sub _validate_arguments {
    my $self = shift;

    # Only validate the arguments given
    $self->_validate_argument($_) for grep {
        $self->has_argument($_)
            or $self->arguments->{$_}->{constructor}
    } $self->argument_names;

    return $self->result->success;
}

=head2 take_action

Overrides the virtual C<take_action> method on L<Jifty::Action> to
call the appropriate C<Jifty::Record>'s C<set_> methods when the
action is run, thus updating the object in the database.

=head2 report_success

Sets the L<Jifty::Result/message> to default success message,
"Updated". Override this if you want to report some other more
user-friendly result.

Update actions do not provide fields for columns marked as C<private>
or C<protected>.
